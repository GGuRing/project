  title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a cross-platform, <strong>object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive</strong> (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
environment to provide programmatic control over them.
<br><br>
JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
<br><br>
for example: Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another
of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
<br><br>
This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests
sent by code executed in the browser.</p>
